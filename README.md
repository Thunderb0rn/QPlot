### QPlot

A simple C++ program with Qt.
It allows you to build mathematical graphs, it allows you to visualize how the graph looks like, why the function has no roots.

It is possible to set the color of the graph (only when creating it), delete and create it.

It is planned to make:
**1) Multithreading, since the program hangs when creating a graph.**
**2) The ability to change the color of an already created chart.**
**3) Saving and loading the project.**
